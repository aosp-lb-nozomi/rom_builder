<@center><b><#selectbg_g>Welcome</#></b>

Welcome to Marvellous ROM, let's run you past some basics...

Marvellous ROM is a free, open ROM. Anybody can take the source used in any part of Marvellous ROM it. E.g. sources for Marvellous CM10 are here: <b>github.com/MarvellousCM10</b>. Marvellous ROM is based on Android and always will be.

<b><#selectbg_g>Updates</#></b>

When Marvellous ROM is updated you will be notified on the main thread, you can also receive OTA updates (there is an OTA update center included)

<b><#selectbg_g>Your information</#></b>

I will NEVER collect, store or use your information in anyway when you're using this ROM. However, third-party packages (such as software you download from the internet) may be able to do. People who look over your shoulder when you are typing in credit card information may also be able to see some information, but this is not my doing. Please note that the ROM has statistic monitoring applications - I recommend you read its privacy policies at http://cyanogenmod.org/terms-of-use .

<b><#selectbg_g>Packages</#></b>

I am totally NOT responsible if a package doesn't work, blame the developer of that package. Please do not report that something does not work when somebody has already pointed out that it doesn't work. I will remove broken packages in updates to come.

<b><#selectbg_g>Bugs</#></b>

Marvellous ROM has been tested quite well and should never give you any problems when using any packages, however - sometimes bad things happen and there may be one line of code that is incorrect and may cause a package to install or even the wrong package to install. When something bad does happen please take a log of the problem - we highly recommend using the Android SDK 'adb logcat' command to report a problem.

<b><#selectbg_g>CDMA support</#></b>

Marvellous ROM does not provide full CDMA support and this is probably never going to change.
