djolivier (me) made the ROM, however, I couldn't have done it without the following people (in no particular order)...

- My awesome team for doing a great job
- amarullz (AROMA installer)
- alquez (original msm7k kernel and marvel device tree)
- modpunk (for porting CM10)
- the cyanogenmod team (for cm10)
- HTC
- Google
- my WFS for bearing my experiments
- OliverG96
- benjamingwynn
- dudeman1996
- my testers
- xda (for housing my wonderful rom thread)
